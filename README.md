# UnityCop
A StyleCop implementation for Unity.

# Installation
It is recommended to install through the Unity Package Manager.

If you wish to manually install, clone the repository into the `Packages` folder of your project.

# How to Use
Any assemblies you wish to utilize stylecop simply need to reference the 'Sparkade.UnityCop' assembly.
A good default ruleset is included, but will not apply automatically. Copy it to your assets folder and rename it to 'Default.ruleset' to apply globally to your project.
Check the Unity documentation for how to use ruleset files if you need more control over the ruleset's scope.
